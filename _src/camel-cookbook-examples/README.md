Apache Camel Developer's Cookbook Samples
=========================================

This project contains the sample code for the [_Apache Camel Developer's Cookbook_](http://www.packtpub.com/apache-camel-developers-cookbook/book)
(Packt Publishing, Dec 2013) by [Scott Cranton](https://github.com/scranton) and [Jakub Korab](https://github.com/jkorab).
The latest version of this code is available on [GitHub](http://github.com/CamelCookbook/camel-cookbook-examples).

All of the examples are driven through JUnit tests, and are collectively structured as a set
of Apache Maven projects. To execute them, you will need a copy of the [Java 7 JDK]
(http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) (6 should be OK as well)
and an [Apache Maven 3](http://maven.apache.org/) installation . Maven will download
all of the appropriate project dependencies.

In order to execute all the tests, all you need to do is run:

    $ mvn clean install

You will find the sample code laid out for the chapters as follows:
